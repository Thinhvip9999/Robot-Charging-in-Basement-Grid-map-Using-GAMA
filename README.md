# Robot-Charging-in-Basement-Grid-map-Using-GAMA
A simulation project leveraging GAMA to model and analyze robot charging strategies within a basement grid map environment. The project focuses on optimizing the movement and charging behavior of robots in a confined grid-like space, simulating real-world scenarios like warehouse automation or underground service robotics.
